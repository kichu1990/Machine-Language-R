#The model we built does not display the relationship we saw from the plot of life expectancy
#vs. income. Which of the following explanations seems the most reasonable?
#Multicollinearity

#Although income is an insignificant variable in the model, this does not mean that there is 
#no association between income and life expectancy. However, in the presence of all of the 
#other variables, income does not add statistically significant explanatory power to the model.
#This means that multicollinearity is probably the issue.
