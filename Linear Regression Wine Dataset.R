#R² = 1 - SSE/SST,
#where SST is calculated using the average value of the dependent variable on the training set.
#Since SSE and SST are the sums of squared terms, we know that both will be positive.
#Thus SSE/SST must be greater than or equal to zero. 
#This means it is not possible to have an out-of-sample R² value of 2.4.
#However, all other values are valid (even the negative ones!), since SSE can be more or less than SST, due to the fact that this is 
#an out-of-sample R², not a model R².
